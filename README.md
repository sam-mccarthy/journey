# Journey
## What is it?
Journey is intended to be a daily journaling app built to be open-source, primarily for self-hosting.

## TO-DO
- ~~Run through and comment code~~
- ~~Sketch out database structure~~
- Implement session keys
- Begin building React frontend

- ~~SQL Exec calls need to be sanitized.~~ This is already done by database/sql.
- Returning .Error() straight may expose sensitive information, so later on this will need to be mitigated.
